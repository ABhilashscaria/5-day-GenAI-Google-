However, he is on at me to\\nget some product called Dalacin T, which used to be a\\ndoctor's-prescription only treatment but is not available over the\\nchemist's counter.  I have asked a couple of pharmacists who say\\neither his acne is not severe enough for Dalacin T, or that Clearasil\\nis OK.  I had the odd spots as a teenager, nothing serious.  His\\nfather was the same, so I don't figure his acne is going to escalate\\ninto something disfiguring.  But I know kids are senstitive about\\ntheir appearance.  I am wary because a neighbour's son had this wierd\\nmalady that was eventually put down to an overdose of vitamin A from\\nacne treatment.  I want to help - but with appropriate treatment.\\n\\nMy son also has some scaliness around the hairline on his scalp.  Sort\\nof teenage cradle cap.  Any pointers/advice on this?  We have tried a\\ncouple of anti dandruff shampoos and some of these are inclined to\\nmake the condition worse, not better.\\n\\nShall I bury the kid till he's 21 :)\\n\\n-- \\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n            The floggings will continue until morale improves              \\n      Pat Churchill, Wellington New Zealand \\n\",\n          \"Re: Is MSG sensitivity superstition?\\n\\nIn article <>  (Daniel Myers) writes:\\n>I am under the impression that MSG \\\"enhances\\\" flavor by causing the\\n>taste buds to swell.\\n\\nNo, that's not how it works.\\n\\n>If this is correct, I do not find it unreasonable\\n>to assume that high doses of MSG can cause other mouth tissues to swell.\\n\\nThis may be through a different mechanism.\\n\\n>Also, as the many of the occurances (including two of the above)\\n>involved beef, and as beef is frequently tenderized with MSG, this is\\n>what I suspect as being the cause.\\n\\nTenderizing beef involves sprinking or marinading it in papain, an enzyme.\\n\\\"Meat tenderizer\\\" packets might contain papain and MSG and seasonings, but\\nMSG doesn't act as a tenderizer.\\n\\n-- \\nSteve Dyer\\n aka {ima,harvard,rayssd,linus,m2c}!spdcc!dyer\\n\",\n          \"Another key registration body bites the dust (IMHO)\\n\\nOne of the candidates that has been suggested for a key registration\\nbody is the ACLU.  I think this is poor choice.   The ACLU is\\nessentially a group of auditors: they audit how people's civil\\nliberties are administered.  Traditionally, auditors do not like to get\\ninvolved in the design or operational aspects of things, and with good\\nreason.\\n\\nWhen I was a systems programmer, it always infuriated me that the\\nauditors would come in and tell us our implementation stunk from a\\nsecurity point of view, but wouldn't tell us how to fix it.  I always\\nfigured they just liked to critcize, without doing the work to help fix\\nthe problem.\\n\\nThen I took a stint as an auditor, and I found out the real reason.\\nAuditors don't like to recommend solutions, because it puts them in a\\nbad position if they have to criticize the implementation later.  The\\nauditee can say, \\\"Well, you told us this way would be OK.\\\"  It\\ncompromises the independence that is a necessary part of the auditor's\\njob.\\n\\nTaking the case at hand, suppose ACLU becomes a key half registrar.\\nSuppose that, perhaps through some error on ACLU's part, a key half gets\\naway that shouldn't, and is used to deprive someone of her civil\\nliberties.  The ACLU gets wind of this, and wants to take it to court.\\nBut they end up being at the same time on the side of the defendant\\nand of the plaintiff, which is not an easy position to be in.\\n\\nThere are exceptions to the complete independence of auditors: at one\\nplace where I worked, when payroll checks were printed, they were signed\\nautomatically by a signature drum on the bursting machine.  This drum\\nwas kept by the auditors (who also kept the check stock), and\\nwas brought down to Data Processing when it was time to do the checks.\\n\\nI believe the difference between this situation and the key registration\\nsituation is that it is fairly obvious when it is time to do the payroll\\nchecks:  if they were done yesterday, and someone wants to do them again\\ntoday, he better be able to produce yesterday's checks so that they can\\nbe destroyed.  Determining which of the many requests for key halves are\\nlegit is a trickier process, one much more prone to mistakes that could\\nput the ACLU in a protecting-the-client versus protecting-the-ACLU\\nconflict of interest.\\n\\nAs always, my opinions are my own.\\n\\nLynn Grant\\n\\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 1,\n        \"min\": 11,\n        \"max\": 14,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 4,\n        \"samples\": [\n          12,\n          14,\n          11\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Class Name\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 4,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"sci.electronics\",\n          \"sci.space\",\n          \"sci.crypt\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Encoded Label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"int8\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 4,\n        \"samples\": [\n          1,\n          3,\n          0\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Embeddings\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":14}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["import keras\n","from keras import layers\n","\n","\n","def build_classification_model(input_size: int, num_classes: int) -> keras.Model:\n","    return keras.Sequential(\n","        [\n","            layers.Input([input_size], name=\"embedding_inputs\"),\n","            layers.Dense(input_size, activation=\"relu\", name=\"hidden\"),\n","            layers.Dense(num_classes, activation=\"softmax\", name=\"output_probs\"),\n","        ]\n","    )"],"metadata":{"id":"xw0G5aCiFxmn","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1732567867424,"user_tz":0,"elapsed":2612,"user":{"displayName":"Abhilash Scaria","userId":"11656765587102373654"}}},"execution_count":15,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Derive the embedding size from observing the data.
